  description: Some members of the office seem to think Cameron is a vampire. I may be a werewolf, but I don’t believe in vampires. Sure, I’ll admit no one’s seen Cameron doze off despite always looking ghastly, but that’s just because she’s a hard worker! Although... there WAS that one time Cameron didn’t appear in the team photo...
