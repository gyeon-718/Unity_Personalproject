  description: 'This is one of the discontinued plushies that never made it to market. The idea was to make a premium plushie out of pure gold. Stupid idea. When tested, the plushie was extremely uncomfortable to snuggle with. I think this is the only one they ever made. Oh well, maybe it can help pay next monthâ€™s rent. '
