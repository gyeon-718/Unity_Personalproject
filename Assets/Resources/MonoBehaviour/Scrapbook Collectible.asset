  description: I never made it into this scrapbook. I’ve seen a lot of the random things employees do instead of working. I can’t say that I’m jealous that those people are in this book and I’m not. Afterall, it’s better if I remain unseen. But I always get my job done. Sometimes, I do think about what things would be like if I wasn’t what I am.
