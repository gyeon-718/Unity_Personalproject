  description: 'These were baked by Janina. She normally brings freshly baked chocolate chip cookies for everyone. During my first week working here, she noticed I didn’t grab a chocolate chip cookie. Chocolate and dogs never mix well, so I stayed away. But she just thinks that I don’t like chocolate. Ever since that first week, she’s always baked one peanut butter cookie just for me. '
