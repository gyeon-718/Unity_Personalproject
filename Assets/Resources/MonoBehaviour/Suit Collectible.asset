  name: The CEO's Suit
  description: The CEO has several suits tailored exactly like this. People dislike the CEO for many reasons. His decisions aren’t the most employee-friendly, to put it lightly. It’s the CEO’s fault for enforcing this overnight work week. Hm... it’s a pretty nice suit. Maybe I can wear it to my next job interview if things don’t work out here.
